# Yiingine
The Yiingine is a highly customizable content management system built on the [Yii 2.0 framework](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2). Made for developpers by developpers, the Yiingine has been conceived with ease of customization and extensibility as its core principles, providing reliable and reusable administrative and client site management components so developpers can focus their energy on work that makes their applications unique.
* developped using proven technologies and techniques:
 * runs on Yii 2.0, building on its simplicity, speed and extendability, 
 * easy front-end development and/or theming with [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/);
 * simple and painless deployment and maintenance using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/);
* fully functionnal administration interface using Yii 2.0's powerful GridView and a simple and intuitive layout;
* numerous components can be harnessed to create any type of front-end;
* core models can be customized at will to adapt them to the application's needs;
* fully internationalizable content (translations currently in English and French);
* speedy execution thanks to built-in caching;
* powerful user management with role based access control.
